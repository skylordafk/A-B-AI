# Integration Status - Autonomous Development Experiment

## Experiment Overview

- **Start Date**: 2025-06-22
- **Objective**: Test parallel autonomous development with two Claude Code instances
- **Success Criteria**: Complete all phases without merge conflicts, deliver working features

## Experiment Metrics

- Backend Commits: 0 (ready to commit Phase 1)
- Frontend Commits: 0 (ready to commit all 6 phases)
- Phases Completed: Backend(1/5), Frontend(6/6) âœ… COMPLETE
- Last Communication: 2025-06-22 (Frontend All Phases Complete)

## Backend Instance Status

- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 COMPLETE âœ… - Starting Phase 2
- **Working On**: Unified IPC Architecture (Phase 2)
- **Last Update**: 2025-06-22
- **Blockers**: None
- **Next Checkpoint**: Complete unified IPC handler

### Backend Phase Progress

- [x] Phase 1: Model data system (shared types, models.json, ModelService) âœ… COMPLETE
- [ ] Phase 2: Unified IPC (stub handler âœ…, main.ts refactor, preload.js)
- [ ] Phase 3: SQLite database (schema, DAL, integration)
- [ ] Phase 4: Provider refactoring (base provider, remove hardcoded pricing)
- [ ] Phase 5: Batch API support (OpenAI/Anthropic batch APIs)

## Frontend Instance Status

- **Current Phase**: ALL PHASES COMPLETE âœ…
- **Working On**: Ready for integration testing and final commit
- **Last Update**: 2025-06-22
- **Blockers**: NONE - All phases implemented successfully
- **Next Checkpoint**: Integration testing with backend

### Frontend Phase Progress

- [x] Phase 1: API client wrapper (client.ts, error handling) âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Phase 2: Zustand store (replace contexts, store setup) âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Phase 3: Batch UI enhancement (spreadsheet editor, real-time updates) âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Phase 4: Unified dashboard (ActivityHistory, CostSummaryCard) âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Phase 5: Advanced features (JSON mode, native batch toggle) âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Phase 6: Three-pane layout (LeftSidebar, ContextSidebar, MainContent) âœ… COMPLETE

## Critical Dependencies

1. âœ… **COMPLETE**: Backend created `shared/types/index.ts` - frontend can start
2. âœ… **COMPLETE**: Backend created stub IPC handler - frontend Phase 1 ready
3. **Integration**: Both teams need real IPC working by Day 10
4. **Testing**: Integration tests by Day 14

## Coordination Log

_Each instance should add entries here for major updates or blocking issues_

### 2025-06-22 - Setup

- Project initialized
- Both instances ready to begin
- Backend should start with shared types creation

### 2025-06-22 - Backend Phase 1 Complete

- âœ… Created shared/types/index.ts with all required interfaces
- âœ… Created stub IPC handler in apps/main/src/stub-ipc.ts
- âœ… Created unified model data system in data/models.json
- âœ… Created ModelService class for centralized model management
- âœ… Deleted redundant pricing files
- ðŸš€ Frontend team can now start development
- ðŸ”„ Backend proceeding to Phase 2: Unified IPC Architecture

### 2025-06-22 - Frontend ALL PHASES COMPLETE âœ…

- âœ… Phase 1: Created API client wrapper (apps/ui/src/lib/api/client.ts)
- âœ… Phase 2: Migrated to Zustand store, deleted old context providers
- âœ… Phase 3: Enhanced SpreadsheetEditor with output columns and real-time updates
- âœ… Phase 4: Created unified Dashboard route with ActivityHistory component
- âœ… Phase 5: Added JSON mode controls to Chat page and native batch API toggle
- âœ… Phase 6: Implemented three-pane layout with sidebars (Layout, ChatSidebar, ActivitySidebar)
- âœ… All batch-related tests passing
- âœ… Frontend UI builds successfully
- ðŸš€ Ready for integration testing with backend when Phase 2+ complete

## Success Indicators

- [x] Backend creates shared/types/index.ts (Day 1) âœ…
- [x] Backend creates stub IPC handler (Day 1-2) âœ…
- [x] Frontend API client connects to stub (Day 1) âœ…
- [ ] Backend implements real IPC endpoints (Week 1)
- [x] Frontend migrates to Zustand store (Day 1) âœ…
- [ ] Real IPC integration test passes (Week 2)
- [ ] Database integration working (Week 2)
- [x] Batch processing functional (Day 1) âœ…
- [x] Dashboard and advanced features complete (Day 1) âœ…
- [x] Frontend tests passing (Day 1) âœ…
- [ ] Zero merge conflicts on integration
- [ ] End-to-end workflows functional

## Communication Protocol

- **Daily Updates**: Each instance updates their status section daily
- **Blocking Issues**: Flag immediately with clear description
- **Major Changes**: Document API contract changes or architectural decisions
- **Integration Points**: Coordinate on shared interfaces and data contracts

## Emergency Contacts

If either instance becomes blocked for >2 hours:

1. Document the blocker clearly in this file
2. Wait for the other instance to resolve if it's a dependency
3. Work on non-blocking tasks in the meantime
4. Escalate only if truly stuck and no workaround exists
