# ✅ CI/CD Security Upgrade Checklist

## Overview

This checklist ensures all CI/CD security upgrades are properly implemented after the security-focused changes in the `license-management` branch.

## 🔧 Pre-Upgrade Steps

- [ ] **Backup Current Configuration**

  ```bash
  cp .github/workflows/ci.yml .github/workflows/ci.yml.backup
  cp .eslintrc.cjs .eslintrc.cjs.backup
  ```

- [ ] **Review Current Issues**
  - Console statements in test files causing lint errors
  - Pre-commit hooks being bypassed
  - Security tests not enforced

## 📋 Implementation Checklist

### 1. ESLint Configuration

- [ ] Update `.eslintrc.cjs` with test file overrides
- [ ] Verify console statements allowed in test files:
  ```bash
  pnpm lint tests/
  ```

### 2. Pre-commit Hooks

- [ ] Update `.husky/pre-commit` with comprehensive checks
- [ ] Test pre-commit hook:
  ```bash
  echo "console.log('test')" >> apps/ui/src/test.ts
  git add apps/ui/src/test.ts
  git commit -m "Test commit" # Should fail
  git restore apps/ui/src/test.ts
  ```

### 3. CI Workflow Updates

- [ ] Replace `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with enhanced version
- [ ] Add `.github/workflows/security.yml` for daily audits
- [ ] Verify workflow syntax:
  ```bash
  # Install act for local testing (optional)
  act -l
  ```

### 4. Repository Secrets

- [ ] Add required secrets in GitHub:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (if not already set)
  - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (for webhook tests)
  - `ADMIN_API_KEY` (optional, for admin endpoints)

### 5. Test Script Verification

- [ ] Ensure all test scripts exist and are executable:
  ```bash
  ls -la tests/license-e2e.test.js
  ls -la tests/test-stripe-webhooks.js
  ls -la tests/test-security-comprehensive.js
  ls -la tests/test-production-integration.js
  ls -la tests/test-packaged-app.js
  ```

## 🧪 Testing the Upgrade

### Local Testing

- [ ] Run full test suite:

  ```bash
  pnpm test:all
  ```

- [ ] Test individual components:
  ```bash
  pnpm lint
  pnpm tsc --noEmit
  pnpm test
  pnpm test:license
  ```

### CI Testing

- [ ] Create a test PR to trigger workflows
- [ ] Verify all jobs run successfully
- [ ] Check artifacts are uploaded
- [ ] Confirm security reports generated

## 🚀 Post-Upgrade Verification

### Security Checks

- [ ] No console.log in production code
- [ ] No exposed secrets in codebase
- [ ] All security tests passing
- [ ] Daily security audit scheduled

### Developer Experience

- [ ] Pre-commit hooks work correctly
- [ ] Clear error messages on failures
- [ ] Tests run in parallel for speed
- [ ] Documentation is accessible

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] **All CI jobs green** on main branch
- [ ] **Security score > 90%** in audit
- [ ] **Zero high-severity vulnerabilities**
- [ ] **Pre-commit hooks prevent bad commits**
- [ ] **Daily security audits running**

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

```bash
# Restore original CI workflow
mv .github/workflows/ci.yml.backup .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Restore ESLint config
mv .eslintrc.cjs.backup .eslintrc.cjs

# Disable pre-commit temporarily
mv .husky/pre-commit .husky/pre-commit.disabled
```

## 📝 Notes

- The upgraded CI runs on multiple OS (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Security tests require license server to be running
- Some tests may be skipped if secrets aren't configured
- CodeQL analysis provides deep security insights

## 🎯 Next Steps After Upgrade

1. **Monitor CI Performance**

   - Track build times
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize slow tests

2. **Security Baseline**

   - Document current vulnerabilities
   - Set improvement targets
   - Schedule regular reviews

3. **Team Training**
   - Share new workflow with team
   - Document common issues
   - Create troubleshooting guide

## ⏰ Timeline

- [ ] Week 1: Implement core changes
- [ ] Week 2: Test and refine
- [ ] Week 3: Team onboarding
- [ ] Week 4: Full production rollout

**Remember**: This upgrade enforces security best practices that were previously optional. While it may slow down initial commits, it prevents security incidents and maintains code quality.
