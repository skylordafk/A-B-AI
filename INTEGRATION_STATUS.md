# Integration Status - Autonomous Development Experiment

## Experiment Overview
- **Start Date**: 2025-06-22
- **Objective**: Test parallel autonomous development with two Claude Code instances
- **Success Criteria**: Complete all phases without merge conflicts, deliver working features

## Experiment Metrics
- Backend Commits: 0 (ready to commit Phase 1)
- Frontend Commits: 0  
- Phases Completed: Backend(1/5), Frontend(0/6)
- Last Communication: 2025-06-22 (Backend Phase 1 Complete)

## Backend Instance Status
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 COMPLETE âœ… - Starting Phase 2
- **Working On**: Unified IPC Architecture (Phase 2)
- **Last Update**: 2025-06-22
- **Blockers**: None
- **Next Checkpoint**: Complete unified IPC handler

### Backend Phase Progress
- [x] Phase 1: Model data system (shared types, models.json, ModelService) âœ… COMPLETE
- [ ] Phase 2: Unified IPC (stub handler âœ…, main.ts refactor, preload.js)
- [ ] Phase 3: SQLite database (schema, DAL, integration)
- [ ] Phase 4: Provider refactoring (base provider, remove hardcoded pricing)
- [ ] Phase 5: Batch API support (OpenAI/Anthropic batch APIs)

## Frontend Instance Status  
- **Current Phase**: DEPENDENCIES READY - Can Start Development!
- **Working On**: Ready to implement API client and begin Phase 1
- **Last Update**: [WAITING FOR FRONTEND UPDATE]
- **Blockers**: NONE - All backend dependencies are ready
- **Next Checkpoint**: API client implementation

### Frontend Phase Progress
- [ ] Phase 1: API client wrapper (client.ts, error handling)
- [ ] Phase 2: Zustand store (replace contexts, store setup)
- [ ] Phase 3: Batch UI enhancement (spreadsheet editor, real-time updates)
- [ ] Phase 4: Unified dashboard (ActivityHistory, CostSummaryCard)
- [ ] Phase 5: Advanced features (JSON mode, native batch toggle)
- [ ] Phase 6: Three-pane layout (LeftSidebar, ContextSidebar, MainContent)

## Critical Dependencies
1. âœ… **COMPLETE**: Backend created `shared/types/index.ts` - frontend can start
2. âœ… **COMPLETE**: Backend created stub IPC handler - frontend Phase 1 ready
3. **Integration**: Both teams need real IPC working by Day 10
4. **Testing**: Integration tests by Day 14

## Coordination Log
*Each instance should add entries here for major updates or blocking issues*

### 2025-06-22 - Setup
- Project initialized
- Both instances ready to begin
- Backend should start with shared types creation

### 2025-06-22 - Backend Phase 1 Complete
- âœ… Created shared/types/index.ts with all required interfaces
- âœ… Created stub IPC handler in apps/main/src/stub-ipc.ts
- âœ… Created unified model data system in data/models.json
- âœ… Created ModelService class for centralized model management
- âœ… Deleted redundant pricing files
- ðŸš€ Frontend team can now start development
- ðŸ”„ Backend proceeding to Phase 2: Unified IPC Architecture

## Success Indicators
- [x] Backend creates shared/types/index.ts (Day 1) âœ…
- [x] Backend creates stub IPC handler (Day 1-2) âœ…
- [ ] Frontend API client connects to stub (Day 3)
- [ ] Backend implements real IPC endpoints (Week 1)
- [ ] Frontend migrates to Zustand store (Week 1)
- [ ] Real IPC integration test passes (Week 2)
- [ ] Database integration working (Week 2)
- [ ] Batch processing functional (Week 3)
- [ ] Dashboard and advanced features complete (Week 3)
- [ ] All tests passing (Week 4)
- [ ] Zero merge conflicts on integration
- [ ] End-to-end workflows functional

## Communication Protocol
- **Daily Updates**: Each instance updates their status section daily
- **Blocking Issues**: Flag immediately with clear description
- **Major Changes**: Document API contract changes or architectural decisions
- **Integration Points**: Coordinate on shared interfaces and data contracts

## Emergency Contacts
If either instance becomes blocked for >2 hours:
1. Document the blocker clearly in this file
2. Wait for the other instance to resolve if it's a dependency
3. Work on non-blocking tasks in the meantime
4. Escalate only if truly stuck and no workaround exists
