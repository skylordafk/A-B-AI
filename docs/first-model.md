## Troubleshooting

### "API key not set" error

### Models not appearing

- Ensure you have the corresponding API key saved
- Some models require specific access (e.g., GPT-4 requires API access)

### App won't start

- Make sure you're using Node.js 18 or higher: `node --version`
- Try deleting `node_modules` and running `pnpm install` again
