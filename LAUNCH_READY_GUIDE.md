```

```bash
ssh root@159.223.155.150
cd /root/abai-license-server
cp production-license-server.js production-license-server-secure.js
pm2 restart abai-license-server
```

**Test the fix:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://license.spventerprises.com/validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key":"test-key"}'
```
