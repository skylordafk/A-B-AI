| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Packaging**          | • `electron-builder.yml` re-introduced with ASAR enabled and selective unpack rules.<br>• NSIS Windows target verified; installer size cut by \~35 %.<br>• macOS target scripted but currently disabled in CI pending notarisation. |
| **CI/CD**              | • GitHub Actions matrix builds Node 18/20 on Windows & macOS.<br>• Artifacts uploaded per-run; “Download” table in README auto-updates via release action.                                                                          |
| **Testing**            | • Playwright smoke test (`tests/smoke.spec.ts`) opens the packaged app and asserts window title.<br>• Vitest unit tests migrated to dedicated `tests/` folder.                                                                      |
| **Release Management** | • Release notes now live in `/release-notes.md` and version-specific files (e.g. `release-notes-v1.0.2.md`).<br>• Step-by-step checklist captured in `GITHUB_RELEASE_STEPS.md`.                                                     |
| **Documentation**      | • README rewritten with 30-second Quick-Start, download badges, and project diagram.<br>• Docs folder scaffolded for future in-depth guides (`docs/ROADMAP.md`, `USAGE.md`).                                                        |
| **Binary Delivery**    | • Windows installer `A-BAI-Setup.exe` published with tag `v1.0.2` on Jun 11 2025. ([github.com][2])                                                                                                                                 |

### 5️⃣ Known Issues / Technical Debt

1. **macOS DMG pipeline** disabled until notarisation and code-signing certificates are configured.
2. **Settings dialog** placeholder only—API keys are stored but UI to edit them post-setup is TODO.
3. **Model pricing JSON** is loaded at runtime; needs a cron update job or CI sync to keep rates fresh.
4. **Automated updater** (Sparkle/NSIS) not yet integrated; users must manually download new versions.
