# Deploy Download Page Error Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Automatic Trigger Causing Frequent Failures

**Problem**: The "Deploy Download Page" workflow was configured to trigger on every push to `docs/**` files, causing frequent deployment attempts even for minor documentation changes.

**Solution**: Changed the workflow to manual trigger only via `workflow_dispatch`, preventing automatic failures on every documentation update.

### 2. Hardcoded Version References

**Problem**: The deployment workflows and download page were hardcoded to reference v1.0.0, while the current version is v1.1.0, causing broken download links.

**Solution**:

- Updated `docs/download.html` to reference the current v1.1.0
- Modified workflows to dynamically fetch and use the latest release version
- Added version detection from `package.json`

### 3. Lack of Proper Release Integration

**Problem**: Download page deployment was not synchronized with actual releases, causing outdated links.

**Solution**:

- Added automatic download page deployment to the package workflow after successful release creation
- Ensured download page is updated with correct version numbers and links when new releases are published

### 4. Missing Error Handling and Concurrency Control

**Problem**: No proper concurrency control or error handling, causing potential conflicts between multiple deployments.

**Solution**:

- Added concurrency groups to prevent overlapping deployments
- Added proper error handling and cleanup steps
- Improved logging and status reporting

## Files Modified

1. **`.github/workflows/deploy-pages-manual.yml`**:

   - Changed from automatic to manual trigger
   - Added dynamic release version detection
   - Added concurrency control
   - Improved error handling

2. **`.github/workflows/package.yml`**:

   - Added automatic download page deployment after successful release
   - Integrated version detection from package.json
   - Added proper permissions and environment setup

3. **`docs/download.html`**:
   - Updated all v1.0.0 references to v1.1.0
   - Fixed broken download links

## Usage Instructions

### Manual Deployment

To manually deploy the download page:

1. Go to GitHub Actions in your repository
2. Select "ðŸ“„ Deploy Download Page" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Optionally check "Force deployment" if needed

### Automatic Deployment

The download page will automatically update when:

1. A new tag is pushed (starting with 'v')
2. The package workflow successfully creates a release
3. The deployment will use the current version from `package.json`

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fixes work:

1. Check that no automatic deployments trigger on documentation changes
2. Manually trigger the deploy workflow to test it works
3. Create a test release to verify automatic deployment works
4. Verify all download links in `docs/download.html` are functional

## Future Maintenance

- The download page will automatically stay in sync with new releases
- Version numbers are dynamically detected, reducing maintenance overhead
- Manual deployment option remains available for troubleshooting
