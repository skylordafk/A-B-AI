## Communication Protocol

- **Daily Updates**: Each instance updates their status section daily
- **Blocking Issues**: Flag immediately with clear description
- **Major Changes**: Document API contract changes or architectural decisions
- **Integration Points**: Coordinate on shared interfaces and data contracts

## Emergency Contacts

If either instance becomes blocked for >2 hours:

1. Document the blocker clearly in this file
2. Wait for the other instance to resolve if it's a dependency
3. Work on non-blocking tasks in the meantime
4. Escalate only if truly stuck and no workaround exists
