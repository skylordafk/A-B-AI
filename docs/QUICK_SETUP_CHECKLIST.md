- âœ… Server running at `https://license.spventerprises.com`
- âœ… Webhook endpoint configured and working
- âœ… License validation functioning correctly
- âœ… All tests passing

## Final Steps for Production Use

### 1. Set up Stripe Product & Pricing

- Go to your Stripe Dashboard â†’ Products
- Create a product for "A-B/AI License"
- Set your price and get the Price ID (starts with `price_`)

### 2. Update Frontend Configuration

- Update `apps/ui/src/shared/stripe.ts` with your Price ID
- Verify your Stripe publishable key is correct

### 3. Test Complete Customer Flow

- Build your app in production mode
- Test the full flow: app launch â†’ email entry â†’ Stripe checkout â†’ license activation

## âœ… Ready for Customers!

Your customers can now:

1. Launch A-B/AI app
2. Enter email for activation
3. Complete Stripe checkout
4. Automatically receive license
5. Use app immediately

The integration handles payments, license creation, and validation automatically! ðŸš€

### 4. Final Checks

- [ ] **Run E2E tests**: `npm run test:e2e`
- [ ] **Review `electron-builder.yml`**: Confirm build configurations.
- [ ] **Build for production**: `npm run package`
- [ ] **Test the packaged app**: Locate and run the executable in the `dist/` folder.
- [ ] **Push to `main`**: Merge your feature branch.
- [ ] **Tag a release**: `git tag v1.x.x && git push --tags`
- [ ] **Create GitHub Release**: Draft release notes and upload build artifacts.
- [ ] **Verify downloads**: Check that the new version is available on the download page.
