## About

A desktop application built with Electron, Vite, and React for AI model comparison and cost analysis.

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo managed by pnpm with the following structure:

```
ABAI/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main/      # Electron main process
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui/        # React UI (Vite)
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/          # Documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/         # Test files
â””â”€â”€ package.json   # Root workspace config
```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- pnpm >= 8.0.0

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skylordafk/A-B-AI.git
cd A-B-AI
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development

Run the app in development mode with hot-reload:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will:

- Start the Vite dev server for the React UI
- Launch Electron with the dev server URL
- Open DevTools in detached mode

## Building

Build all packages:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Production

Run the built app:

```bash
pnpm start:prod
```

## Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Start development environment
- `pnpm build` - Build all packages
- `pnpm start:prod` - Run production build
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint
- `pnpm format` - Format code with Prettier

## Architecture

- **Main Process** (`apps/main`): Handles window management, native menus, and system integration
- **Renderer Process** (`apps/ui`): React application with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Preload Script**: Provides secure IPC communication between main and renderer

## Menu

The app includes a native menu with:

- File â†’ Settings (placeholder for future implementation)
- File â†’ Quit

## Technology Stack

- **Electron** - Desktop framework
- **React** - UI framework
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS
- **pnpm** - Package management
- **ESLint** & **Prettier** - Code quality
- **Husky** & **lint-staged** - Git hooks

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflow runs on push/PR to:

- Lint code
- Build packages
- Test on Windows and macOS with Node.js 18.x and 20.x

## Next Steps

Refer to `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the complete development roadmap.
